- Client-side form handling with loading animation and feedback
- Server-side origin validation for enhanced security

   ```

1. Clone this repository faster than Mr. Bean can get into trouble:

   ```
   https://github.com/Student408/PHP-SMTP-MAIL.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd PHP-SMTP-MAIL
   ```
3. Configure your SMTP settings and allowed origins in `config.php`:

   ```php
   return [
       'smtp' => [
           'username' => 'mr.bean@example.com',
           'password' => 'your_secure_password',
           'host' => 'smtp.gmail.com',
           'port' => 587,
           'encryption' => 'tls',
       ],
       'receiver' => [
           'email' => 'mr.bean.receiver@example.com',
           'name' => 'Mr. Bean',
       ],
       'allowed_origins' => [
           'http://localhost',
           'https://mr.bean.example.com',
           'http://127.0.0.1',
           'http://127.0.0.1:5500'
       ],
   ];
   ```
4. Update the fetch URL in `email.js` to point to your `send_email.php` file:

   ```javascript
   fetch('https://yourwebsite.com/send_email.php', {
       // ...
   })
   ```
5. Customize the email templates in the `email_template` directory:

   - `acknowledgement_email.html`: Sent to the person contacting Mr. Bean
   - `receiver_notification.html`: Sent to Mr. Bean (or his assistant)

## üé¨ Usage

1. Host the files on a PHP-enabled web server.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Fill out the contact form with a name sillier than Mr. Bean's and submit it to test the email functionality.
4. Watch for the loading animation and feedback message.

## üìÅ File Structure

- `config.php`: Configuration file for SMTP settings and allowed origins
- `email.js`: Client-side JavaScript for form handling and AJAX submission
- `index.html`: HTML file containing the contact form and portfolio structure
- `send_email.php`: Server-side PHP script for processing form submissions and sending emails
- `smtp/`: Directory containing PHPMailer files
- `email_template/`:
  - `acknowledgement_email.html`: Template for the auto-reply sent to the contactor
  - `receiver_notification.html`: Template for the notification sent to Mr. Bean

## üîí Security Notes

- This project includes basic origin validation, but additional security measures should be implemented for production use. Mr. Bean takes security seriously (when he remembers to)!
- SMTP credentials are stored in plain text in `config.php`. Use environment variables or other secure methods to store sensitive information in a production environment.
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization before using in a production environment. We don't want any mischief-makers sending Mr. Bean spam!

## üß∏ Email Templates

### Acknowledgement Email

The `acknowledgement_email.html` template features:

- A whimsical greeting from Mr. Bean
- A teddy bear icon
- Playful message acknowledging receipt of the contact form submission
- Social media links (GitHub and Buy Me a Coffee)
- Mr. Bean's signature

### Receiver Notification

The `receiver_notification.html` template includes:

- Clear "New Contact Message" header
- Formatted display of sender's name and email
- Full message content
- Footer indicating the source of the message

## üõú Dependencies

- [PHPMailer](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer): For sending emails via SMTP with the reliability of a well-oiled Mr. Bean scheme. This is already included in the project's `smtp` directory.
